# image_classification
Deep Learning implementation using TensorFlow for Image Classification

The objective of this project is to develop a model capable of correctly classifying images of Dogs and Cats.

I am going to work on a subset of the original Dogs vs. Cats Dataset (**3000 images sampled from the original dataset of 25000 images**) to demonstrate techniques such as Image Augmentation and Droputs and how these techniques contribute in improving performance. The smaller dataset spares us a lot of computing power. I plan on demonstrating my work on the original dataset which demands GPU/High Computing power soon.
